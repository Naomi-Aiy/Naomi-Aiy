I’m a **3rd Year Computer Science student** with a **UI/UX Minor**.

I like creating programs and solutions that **function**, **look beautiful**, and are **intuitive for the user**.

### Some things I’ve built | (ง'-')ง

- **Portfolio** — a home for my work and experiments  
- **Web Dev Job Scraper** — automating the boring part of job hunting  
- **Guess That Engine** — can you identify the engine behind a game from its screenshot?

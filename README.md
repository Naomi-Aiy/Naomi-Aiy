I’m a **3rd Year Computer Science student** with a **UI/UX Minor**.

I like creating programs and solutions that both **function**, **look beautifully**, and are **intuitive for the user**.

Most of what I enjoy lives at the intersection of **logic, design, and user experience**.

### Some things I’ve built

- **Portfolio** — a home for my work and experiments  
- **Web Dev Job Scraper** — automating the boring part of job hunting  
- **Guess That Engine** — a small project just for fun (and curiosity)

### Currently working on

**Seat Watcher**  
A tool to help students get into courses that don’t have waitlists.  
It monitors availability and sends a notification by **email or phone** when a spot opens up.
